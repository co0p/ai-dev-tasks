# How to Get Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
	```sh
	npm install
	```

2. **Start the Go backend:**
	```sh
	cd backend
	go run main.go
	```

3. **Start the Svelte frontend:**
	```sh
	npm run dev
	```

4. **Access the app:**
	Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

The frontend will fetch catalog data from the backend via `/api/catalog` (proxy is configured in Vite).

# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
