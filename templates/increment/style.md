# Writing Style Guidelines (Increment)

Keep increment specs clear, testable, and minimal.

- Clarity: Short sentences, concrete terms; avoid marketing language.
- Voice: Active voice, present tense; e.g., "Add a tray action".
- Specificity: Use measurable signals or observable outcomes.
- Structure: Title, Job Story, Assumption, Acceptance Criteria, Success Signal, Out of Scope.
- Gherkin: Keep criteria crisp; 3–5 scenarios is typical.
- Traceability: Reference constitution principles when relevant.
- Brevity: Focus on the smallest useful change.
