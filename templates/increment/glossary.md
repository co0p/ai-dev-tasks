# Glossary (Increment)

- Increment: The canonical unit of change; a small, testable change scoped to user value (may be a feature, fix, refactor, chore, docs, spike).
- Feature: A user-facing subtype of increment.
- Job Story: Structured user narrative (When/I want/So I can).
- Assumption: Hypothesis explored by this increment.
- Acceptance Criteria: Given/When/Then scenarios that prove behavior.
- Success Signal: Metric or observation verifying the increment.
- Out of Scope: Items explicitly excluded to keep focus.
