# Goal

Define one concrete, small, testable increment (WHAT) that advances the product within the constitution’s guardrails and user priorities.

- Purpose: Produce a focused `increment.md` capturing scope, hypothesis/goal, target users, constraints, and success measures.
- Constraints: Human-first interaction; structured outputs (JSON) are internal-only; no default-first-increment—every increment is explicitly chosen and justified.
- Success: A single increment spec with crisp acceptance criteria, risks/assumptions, and minimal plan inputs that seamlessly inform the Design phase.

This goal ensures each increment is purposeful, bounded by the constitution, and ready to hand off to design.
