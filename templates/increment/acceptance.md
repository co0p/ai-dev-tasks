# Validation Checklist (Increment)

Before saving `increment.md`, validate:

- Completeness: All sections present (Title, Job Story, Assumption, Acceptance, Success Signal, Out of Scope).
- Testability: Acceptance criteria are observable and unambiguous.
- Alignment: Increment aligns with `CONSTITUTION.md`; no conflicts.
- Minimality: Scope is small enough to complete quickly.
- Signal: Success signal is measurable or clearly observable.
- Date: Use YYYY-MM-DD for any date fields.
