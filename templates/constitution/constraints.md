# Context & Constraints

Use this section as a template for capturing constraints during context analysis (Step 2). It helps tailor principles to the project reality.

- Domain Constraints: Regulatory, compliance, data privacy, regional requirements.
- Operational Constraints: Team size, on-call coverage, release cadence, SLAs.
- Technical Constraints: Legacy systems, languages/frameworks that must be used, infrastructure limitations.
- Performance Constraints: Latency targets, throughput, resource budgets.
- Security Constraints: Threat model highlights, authentication/authorization requirements.
- Integration Constraints: External services, APIs, event buses, data contracts.
- Organizational Constraints: Ownership boundaries, approval processes, governance.

Guidance: Prefer listing constraints as bullet points with brief context. Reference constraints directly when explaining principle rationales.
