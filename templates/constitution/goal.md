# Goal

Establish a human-first, actionable project constitution (WHY) that sets enduring principles, constraints, and alignment signals for all future work.

- Purpose: Produce a concise `CONSTITUTION.md` tailored to the project, defining vision, principles, constraints, and an update/governance process.
- Constraints: Interaction remains human-first; any structured outputs (JSON) are internal-only for tooling/CI and never shown to end users.
- Success: Clear principles and constraints that are easy to adopt, guide decisions across increments/design/implementation, and remain stable while allowing governed updates.

This goal frames the constitution as the authoritative foundation informing every subsequent 4DC phase.
