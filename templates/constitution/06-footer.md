## Notes

- This constitution is intended to **guide everyday decisions**
- The constitution itself MAY evolve:
  - When the system, team, or constraints change materially.
  - After significant learning from incidents, experiments, or major redesigns.
  - Changes to the constitution SHOULD be deliberate and documented (e.g. with an ADR or version history).
