# Writing Style Guidelines

Use these rules to keep the constitution direct, testable, and easy to maintain.

- Clarity: Prefer short sentences and concrete nouns/verbs. Avoid vague terms like "robust", "scalable", or "simple" without qualifiers.
- Voice: Use active voice and present tense. Example: "Prefer small PRs" not "Small PRs should be preferred".
- Specificity: Turn intentions into checkable rules. Include measurable thresholds or explicit conditions when practical.
- Structure: For each principle, include Name, Statement, Rationale, and 2–3 In-Practice implications.
- Consistency: Use the same labels for pillars and sections as defined in this template set.
- Scope: Principles govern behavior across the project; avoid team- or sprint-specific rules unless they affect architecture/quality.
- Non-duplication: Avoid restating the same rule in multiple places. Prefer a single authoritative principle.
- Traceability: Where relevant, connect Technical Decisions to Principles (e.g., "adheres to Principle #2").
- Brevity: Favor minimal wording that preserves meaning. Do not include marketing language.
