# Acceptance

An acceptable implementation output:
- Lists high-level tasks mapped to acceptance criteria and design decisions.
- Breaks each high-level task into 2–5 small subtasks with brief verification hints.
- Includes relevant file changes and minimal code snippets where helpful.
- Uses an increment branch and records incremental commits after completing high-level tasks.
- States how the result meets the increment’s acceptance criteria.
- Notes key decisions/trade-offs and any open questions.
