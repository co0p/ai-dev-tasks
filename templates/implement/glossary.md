# Glossary

- Increment: The canonical unit of change; a small, deliverable change with clear acceptance criteria (may be a feature, fix, refactor, chore, docs, or spike).
- Feature: A user-facing subtype of increment.
- ADR: Architecture Decision Record documenting decisions and rationale.
- Increment branch: A dedicated git branch for implementing a specific increment (use configured prefix; see schema-hints `git.featureBranchPrefix`).
