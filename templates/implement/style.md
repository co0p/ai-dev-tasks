# Style

- Be concise, direct, and pragmatic.
- Prefer stepwise, verifiable tasks over broad descriptions.
- Use clear imperative language (e.g., "Create", "Add", "Verify").
- Reference constitution principles and ADRs only when they affect the decision at hand.
- Keep code changes minimal and scoped to the increment.
