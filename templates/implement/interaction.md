# Implementation Interaction Style

- Ask numbered clarifying questions about edge cases, error handling, and integration.
- Use lettered answers (A, B, C, X to skip, _ for custom text).
- Always STOP after questions until user answers or asks to continue.
- Document implementation steps and decisions clearly for both LLMs and humans.
