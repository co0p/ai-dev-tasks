# Goal

Produce a clear, actionable implementation plan and minimal code changes for a single increment that respects the constitution, existing ADRs, and the increment’s design.

- Purpose: Turn the design into working code via small, testable steps.
- Constraints: Human-first interaction; any structured outputs (JSON) are internal-only for tooling/CI.
- Success: A short plan with verifiable steps, incremental commits on an increment branch, and code that satisfies the increment’s acceptance criteria.
