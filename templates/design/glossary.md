# Glossary (Design)

- Increment: The canonical unit of change; a small, testable change (may be a feature, fix, refactor, chore, docs, spike).
- Feature: A user-facing subtype of increment.
- Module: Cohesive unit with a single responsibility.
- Boundary: Interface separating concerns (e.g., adapter, API).
- Adapter: Wrapper isolating external libs/OS specifics.
- Contract: Inputs/outputs for a function or API.
- Observability: Logs/metrics/tests that prove behavior.
