# Goal

Produce a clear, pragmatic technical design (HOW) for a single increment that respects the constitution’s principles and constraints.

- Purpose: Describe architecture, boundaries, data flow, interfaces, and risks for the increment.
- Constraints: Human-first interaction; any structured outputs (JSON) are internal-only for tooling/CI.
- Success: A design that is implementable in small steps, testable, and traceably aligned to the increment and constitution.
