# Writing Style Guidelines (Design)

Keep designs crisp, actionable, and bounded.

- Clarity: Short sentences; avoid vague terms.
- Structure: Modules, responsibilities, boundaries, data flow.
- Interfaces: Name APIs/functions; define inputs/outputs.
- Tests: Note test points and observability.
- Risks: List assumptions and mitigations.
- Traceability: Link to increment and constitution principles.
